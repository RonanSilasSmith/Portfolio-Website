                Hello! It's me! Ronan Smith! I am a guy who has loved computers for basically his entire life and is having a blast learning more! I am not the most interesting person to learn about, but there's still some cool stuff to learn about me! For example: I have spedrun the first level of the VR game "I expect you to die" and my time meets the current world record! That's interesting, That's Detication, That's Ronan Smith.

                So an interesting story: The first challenge I did, I messed up the files so index.html was not in the root file. So I was thinking about how to fix my mistake, and eventually I decided to look it up. I saw someone on stack overflow suggest that you add an index file to reroute to your main file, and I did that. I felt so clever until that assignment got graded, and it was pointed out that I could've just.. moved the file. So the moral of the story is don't overengineer because you're afraid to do the most simple solution, sometimes doing the overengineered way can lead to amazing things, but not in every case.
